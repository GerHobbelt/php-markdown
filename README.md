# PHP-Markdown-Extra on github

This project is derive form [jtopjian's php-markdown-extra][] and the original project at [michelf's origin][].

The purpose of I fork here is that I just want to use the feature of TOC. And I searched on google that [jtopjian's php-markdown-extra] has done that already, but his code is not holden on github. So I copied his code here, and made some improvement for supporting anchor link of TOC.

The TOC usage like this:

	[TOC]

add this tag into anywhere you want, then the compiled page should contain the table of content of your document.

You can fork this for extending more features or use the origin from the authors' project page.
